<h2>What are Agentic Commerce Tools?</h2>
<p>Agentic commerce refers to the use of autonomous agents that can facilitate transactions, negotiate prices, and make decisions on behalf of buyers and sellers. These agents can be powered by AI, machine learning, and natural language processing, enabling them to learn and adapt to user behavior.

<p>Some key features of agentic commerce tools include:
* Automated product recommendations based on user preferences and purchase history
* Personalized pricing and discounts tailored to individual customers
* Intelligent customer service chatbots that can resolve issues and answer queries
* Autonomous negotiation of prices and terms between buyers and sellers</p>
<h2>The Role of AI in E-Commerce</h2>
<p>AI has already started to transform the e-commerce industry in various ways, from chatbots and virtual assistants to predictive analytics and personalized marketing. The integration of AI in e-commerce has enabled businesses to:
