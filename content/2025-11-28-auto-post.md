The world of tech investing is never short on drama, but this Thanksgiving, all eyes are on the showdown between Michael Burry, the famed investor known for predicting the 2008 housing market crash, and Nvidia, the semiconductor giant that has been a darling of the tech industry. The recent news of Burry's short position against Nvidia has sent shockwaves through the financial community, with many wondering what this means for the future of tech investing. In this post, we'll delve into the details of this high-stakes battle and explore what it reveals about the changing landscape of the tech industry.

## The Background: Michael Burry's Track Record
Michael Burry is no stranger to controversy. The investor, who was featured in the book and film "The Big Short," has a reputation for making bold, contrarian bets that often pay off.

Since then, Burry has been known for his scathing critiques of the tech industry, particularly when it comes to valuation and sustainability.

## The Target: Nvidia's Rise to Prominence
Nvidia, on the other hand, has been on a tear in recent years. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for the gaming and artificial intelligence (AI) industries, driving significant revenue growth and earning the company a valuation of over $1 trillion. Nvidia's success has been fueled by the growing demand for AI and machine learning applications, which rely heavily on the company's GPUs.

## The Bet: Burry's Short Position Against Nvidia
So, why is Michael Burry betting against Nvidia? According to reports, Burry's firm, Scion Asset Management, has taken a significant short position against Nvidia, citing concerns about the company's valuation and the potential for a downturn in the AI and gaming markets.
