The way we discover new restaurants and food establishments is undergoing a significant transformation. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and social media, companies are now leveraging these technologies to create innovative platforms that make food discovery more personalized, interactive, and fun. A recent example of this trend is DoorDash's rollout of Zesty, an AI social app designed to help users discover new restaurants and connect with like-minded foodies.

## The Problem with Traditional Food Discovery

Moreover, the sheer volume of information available online can make it difficult for users to discover new restaurants that align with their tastes and preferences.
